The development of practical devices relies on a detailed understanding of how skyrmionic structures can be formed, transferred, detected and annihilated. In this work, our considerations go beyond static skyrmions and theoretically show that the formation/annihilation of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions is enabled by the transient creation and propagation of topological singularities (magnetic monopole-like Bloch points). Critically, during the winding/unwinding of skyrmionic textures, our results predict that the Bloch-point propagation will give rise to an emergent electric field in a terahertz frequency range and with substantial amplitude. We also demonstrate ways for controlling Bloch-point dynamics, which directly enable the tuneability on both frequency and amplitude of this signal. Our studies provide a concept of directly exploiting topological singularities for terahertz skyrmion-based electronic devices.</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Y.

In particular, the investigation of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices offers insight into fundamental processes of topological-charge creation and annihilation upon changing the magnetic state. Nonetheless, the exact physical mechanisms behind these phase transitions remain unresolved. Here, we show numerically that it is possible to collectively reverse the polarity of a skyrmion lattice in a field-induced first-order phase transition via a transient antiskyrmion-lattice state. We thus propose a new type of phase transformation where a skyrmion lattice inverts to another one due to topological constraints. In the presence of even a single defect, the process becomes a second-order phase transition with gradual topological-charge melting. This radical change in the system’s behavior from a first-order to a second-order phase transition demonstrates that defects in real materials could prevent us from observing collective topological phenomena. We have systematically compared ultra-thin films with isotropic and anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs), and demonstrated a nearly identical behavior for such technologically relevant interfacial systems.</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><blockquote><p>L.

In this paper, a universal Monte Carlo simulator is developed based on a cell switching model and a tunneling-based transport model. Driven by external electric field, the growing process of the nanoscale filament occurring in the gap region is actually dominated by cells’ conductive/insulating switching, modeled through a phenomenological physics-based probability function. The electric transport through the partially formed CF is considered as current tunneling in the framework of the Quantum Point Contact model, and the potential barrier is modulated during cells’ evolution. To demonstrate the validity and universality of our simulator, various operation schemes are simulated, with the simulated I − V characteristics well explaining experimental observations. Furthermore, the statistical analyses of simulation results in terms of Weibull distribution and conductance evolution also nicely track previous experimental results. Representing a simulation scale that links atomic-scale simulations to compact modeling, our simulator has the advantage of being much faster comparing with other atomic-scale models. Meanwhile, our simulator shows good universality since it can be applied to various operation signals, and also to different electrodes and dielectric layers dominated by different switching mechanisms.<h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Y.

Filamentary switching based on the formation and rupture of nanoscale conductive filament has been applied in non-volatile memory and volatile selector devices with low power consumption and fast switching speeds. Before the mass production of resistive switching devices, great efforts are still required to enable stable and reliable switching performances. The conductive filament, a bridge of microscopic metal-insulator-metal structure and macroscopic resistance states, plays an irreplaceable part in resistive switching behavior, as unreliable performance often originates from unstable filament behavior. In this Review, departing from the filamentary switching mechanism and the existing issues, recent advances of the switching performance improvement through the conductive filament modulation are discussed, in the sequence of material modulation, device structure design and switching operation scheme optimization. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with excellent properties including and beyond graphene, are discussed with emphasis on performance improvement by their active roles as the switching layer, insertion layer, thin electrode, patterned electrode, and edge electrode, etc.</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Y.
